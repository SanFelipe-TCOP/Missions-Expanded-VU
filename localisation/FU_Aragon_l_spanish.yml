 poet: "Poet" 
 poet_desc: "A poet is a person who creates poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience. The work of a poet is essentially one of communication, either expressing ideas in a literal sense, such as writing about a specific event or place, or metaphorically. Poets have existed since antiquity, in nearly all languages, and have produced works that vary greatly in different cultures and periods. Throughout each civilization and language, poets have used various styles that have changed through the course of literary history, resulting in a history of poets as diverse as the literature they have produced."

 FU_Aragon_Events.1.d: "The trade that flows through the river Nile contains exorbitant amounts of value. To harness the amount of goods that flow through it will not only amount to unimaginable profits but also the introduction of new goods from faraway shores. The recent conquest of the Delta has led to the monopolization of many ventures that span all the way to India and beyond."

 FU_Aragon_Events.2.t: "The Chambers of Lonja de la Seda"
 FU_Aragon_Events.2.d: "Built between 1482 and 1548, la Lonja is composed of three parts (plus the Orange Garden - a walled court-yard). The main hall, Sala de Contratacion (The Contract Hall) is a large lavishly decorated space supported by gorgeous twisted columns. This was the financial centre of La Lonja, where the merchants work out contracts. The side-wing is named the Pavilion of the Consulate, and this was the seat of the Tribunal del Mar - the first marine merchant tribunal to ever be formed in Spain. The first two floors were the main function rooms, with the upper one hosting a richly decorated ceiling. These rooms are still maintained original furnishings. On occasion, the Tribunal would imprison merchants for debts in the central tower of La Lonja - the third part of the structure. \n\nBehind the current building, there was an earlier one from the 14th century, which was called the Oil Exchange (Llotja de l’Oli, in Valencian, or Lonja del Aceite, in Spanish). It was used not only for trading with agricultural oils, but for all kind of business. Where in 1348 was traded perxal (percale) as some kind of silk." 
 FU_Aragon_Events.2.a: "Let us expand the Contract Hall!"

 FU_Aragon_Events.3.d: "The Taula's charter, dated in the 14th century depending on authors, is the oldest preserved public bank regulation. Its design remained essentially unchanged for 300 years until the early 18th century. The Taula was a fully-owned operation of the city with a city guarantee of its deposits, and there is no evidence that it had capital of its own. The city appointed the Taula's taulers who worked on the table and its cashier for two-years fixed terms and paid their salaries. Other Taula officers, including its regent, chief of deposits, credencer in charge of first bookings, and notary, were apponted for life. The Taula's coffers had six keys, of which two were held by each tauler and two by the city councillors. The Taula was also subject to frequent inspection by municipal auditors. \n\nIn 1609, the city council created the Bank of the City of Barcelona (Banc de la Ciutat) as an independent department of the municipal administration, to accept lower-quality coins than were allowed under the Taula's regulation. In practice, that bank appears to have operated as an extension of the Taula rather than a separate let alone competing institution."

The Latin Empire was intended to replace the Byzantine Empire as the Western-recognized Roman Empire in the east, with a Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. \n\nOur recent conquests in the region have risen questions around the potential re-establishment of the old Latin Borders and the expansion in Western Anatolia as well as the Balkans."

 FU_Aragon_Events.6.d: "The relationship between the Princedom of Albania, under Skanderbeg, and the Kingdom of Aragon, under King Alfonso V is an interesting one. Despite the distance between our borders, our genius monarch greatly assisted the Iberian ruler in dealing with various unruly elements during the rebellion of Naples. Perhaps the advancement of the Turks, coupled with the imminent fall of Byzantium and the air of animosity in the Balkans, is a stark indication that we need to seek a powerful protector."

 FU_Aragon_Events.7.d: "The relationship between the Princedom of Albania, under Skanderbeg, and the Kingdom of Aragon, under King Alfonso V, is an interesting one. Despite the distance between our borders, their genius monarch greatly assisted ours in dealing with various unruly elements during the rebellion of Naples. That was the beginning of a friendship that would later blossom into diplomatic vassalage, with the Albanian Princedom falling under Aragonese protection. This new development will certainly be an interesting one as the forts of Albania serve as valuable defensive positions against our enemies in the Balkan region." 
 FU_Aragon_Events.7.a: "Who said the sword is mightier than the pen?" 
 
 FU_Aragon_Events.8.t: "Tirant lo Blanch"
 FU_Aragon_Events.8.d: "Tirant lo Blanch is a chivalric romance written by the Valencian knight Joanot Martorell, finished posthumously by his friend Martí Joan de Galba and published in the city of Valencia in 1490 as an incunabulum edition. The title means "Tirant the White" and is the name of the romance's main character who saves the Byzantine Empire. It is one of the best known medieval works of literature in Valencian. It is considered a masterpiece in the Valencian literature and in the literature in Catalan language as a whole, and it played an important role in the evolution of the Western novel through its influence on the author Miguel de Cervantes. \n\nTirant lo Blanch tells the story of the knight Tirant who has a series of adventures across Europe in his quest. He joins in knightly competitions in England and France until the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire asks him to help in the war against the Ottoman Turks, Islamic invaders threatening Constantinople, the capital and seat of the Empire. Tirant accepts and is made Megaduke of the Byzantine Empire and the captain of an army. He defeats the invaders and saves the Empire from destruction. Afterwards, he fights the Turks in many regions of the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa, but he dies just before he can marry the pretty heiress of the Byzantine Empire."

 FU_Aragon_Events.9.t: "Revolt of the Brotherhoods" 
 FU_Aragon_Events.9.d: "The Revolt of the Brotherhoods  was a revolt by artisan guilds (Germanies) against the government of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the Kingdom of Valencia, part of the Crown of Aragon. It took place from 1519–1523, with most of the fighting occurring during 1521. The Valencian revolt inspired a related revolt in the island of Majorca, also part of Aragon, which lasted from 1521–1523. \n\nThe revolt was an anti-monarchist, anti-feudal autonomist movement inspired by the Italian republics. It also bore a strong anti-Islamic aspect, as rebels rioted against Valencia's peasant Muslim population (also called mudéjars, to contrast with crypto-Muslims or Moriscos in the Crown of Castile, where Islam was outlawed) and imposed forced conversions to Christianity. The agermanats are comparable to the comuneros of neighboring Castile, who fought a similar revolt against Charles from 1520–1522. Both rebellions were partially inspired by the departure for Germany of Charles, the new King of both Castile and Aragon (in a personal union that would form the basis for the Kingdom of Spain), to take the throne as Holy Roman Emperor and leaving behind a somewhat disreputable Royal Council and regent."

 FU_Aragon_Events.10.t: "Furs of Valencia" 
 FU_Aragon_Events.10.d: "The Furs of Valencia were the laws of the Kingdom of Valencia during most of the Middle Ages and early modern Europe. The laws were a series of charters which, altogether, worked similarly as a modern Constitution did later. Thus, they defined the position of and checks and balances between the Royal House, the nobility, the Catholic ecclesiastic and the judicial procedures. The first codifications are based in the Usages of Barcelona, Costums of Lleida, and the Furs of Aragon. \n\nThey were promulgated by the first King of Valencia, James "the Conqueror", in 1261 at the newly created Valencian Parliament; he then subjected the title of King of Valencia to an oath of office before the Parliament, sworn on the Furs. \n\nThe Furs were valid for more than four centuries, until they were abolished by means of the Nueva Planta decrees signed by Philip V of Castile in 1707. Sealing the validity of our own code of administrative conduct, centuries after its conception, will only strengthen the legitimacy of our institutions!"
