Countless countries destroyed, thousands upon thousands of lives lost and an unimaginable amount of coin spent have led us to this.

  pro_reassert_strength_desc: "The home of Duke Rene is but a mere infant compared to it's cousins in the kingdom of France. We should secure more favourable alliances and muster our forces to as many souls as our population can support."

  pro_regne_daragon_desc: "Although different, Catalan and Occitan cultures share some similarities. It is an undisputable truth that the rulers of Aragon are incompetent. We should use this opportunity and seize those lands for ourselves through a union of crowns or direct conquest."

  pro_anoint_superintendent_of_finances_desc: "Our country has grown so large that our ruler can no longer properly oversee the treasury income. We should hire a capable person to do it in his stead.

  pro_diocese_of_avignon_desc: "Not long ago, Avignon used to be part of the ducal lands of our court. Decades later, after the schism between the Papacy of Rome and that of Avignon, the city found itself torn asunder from our grasp.

  pro_crusade_overseas_desc: "Establishing a foothold in the shores of Jerusalem and Palestine was a mere staging ground, a cornerstone for the real campaign. We shall not forget the Christian blood these infidels shed. The Levant must be cleansed and purified!" 
  pro_romanesque_architecture_title: "Romanesque Architecture"
  pro_romanesque_architecture_desc: "Since the days of Charlemagne, the romanesque style has been a symbol of wealth, affluence and splendor among our people. What better way to show off the prestige of our corwn, than to elevate our buildings to the romanesque architectural standard?"

   pro_desu_vult_desc: "The Royal title of Jerusalem was once held by our great monarchs. Years of losses and mismanagement has led to the loss of such a prestigious hold on clerical matters. It would be a move of immesurable prestige and religious fervor to attempt its restoration!"

  FU_Provence_Events.1.t: "An Offer of Integration" 
  FU_Provence_Events.1.d: "The Duchies of Lorraine and Provence have been intertwined for decades. Recent developments on the diplomatic front have opened a pathway to immediate integration. Whether we decide to integrate or sustain our partial independence, this is a matter that needs to be taken very seriously." 
  FU_Provence_Events.1.a: "Let our Duchies unite!"
  FU_Provence_Events.1.b: "Our sovereignty will not be violated!"
  
  FU_Provence_Events.2.t: "The Retrial of Joan d' Arc" 
  FU_Provence_Events.2.d: "In regards to the conduct of Joan of Arc, a posthumous retrial opened after the war ended. The current Pope authorized this proceeding, also known as the "nullification trial", at the request of Inquisitor-General Jean Bréhal and Joan's mother Isabelle Romée. The purpose of the trial was to investigate whether the trial of condemnation and its verdict had been handled justly and according to canon law. Investigations started with an inquest by Guillaume Bouillé, a theologian and former rector of the University of Paris (Sorbonne). \nBréhal conducted an investigation with haste and speed. A formal appeal followed in November of the next year. The appellate process involved clergy from throughout Europe and observed standard court procedure. A panel of theologians analyzed testimony from 115 witnesses. Bréhal drew up his final summary in [GetYear], which describes Joan as a martyr and implicated the late Pierre Cauchon with heresy for having convicted an innocent woman in pursuit of a secular vendetta. The technical reason for her execution had been a Biblical clothing law. The nullification trial reversed the conviction in part because the condemnation proceeding had failed to consider the doctrinal exceptions to that stricture. The appellate court declared her innocent on 7 July [GetYear] and it now befalls up to us to canonize her as a symbol of our people!" 
  FU_Provence_Events.2.a: "Let her be beatified!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.3.t: "Université d'Aix-Marseille"
  FU_Provence_Events.3.d: "The institution developed out of the original University of Provence, founded on 9 December [GetYear] as a studium generale by [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Anjou, Duke of Provence, and recognized by papal bull issued by the current Pope. However, there is evidence that teaching in Aix existed in some form from the beginning of the 12th century, since there were a doctor of theology in 1100, a doctor of law in 1200 and a professor of law in 1320 on the books. The decision to establish the university was, in part, a response to the already-thriving University of Paris. \nAs a result, in order to be sure of the viability of the new institution, [Root.Monarch.GetName] compelled his Provençal students to study in Aix only. Thus, the letters patent for the university were granted, and the government of the university was created. The Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence, Thomas de Puppio, was appointed as the first chancellor of the university for the rest of his life. After his death, a new chancellor was elected by the rector, masters, and licentiates – an uncommon arrangement not repeated at any other French university. The rector was to be an "ordinary student", who had unrestricted civil and criminal jurisdiction in all cases where one party was a doctor or scholar of the university. Those displeased with the rector's decisions could appeal to a doctor legens. Eleven consiliarii provided assistance to the rector, being elected yearly by their predecessors. These individuals represented all faculties, but were elected from among the students. \n\nThe constitution was of a student-university, and the instructors did not have great authority except in granting degrees. A resident doctor or student who married was required to pay charivari to the university, the amount varying with the degree or status of the man, and being increased if the bride was a widow. Refusal to submit to this statutable extortion was punished by the assemblage of students at the summons of the rector with frying-pans, bassoons, and horns at the house of the newly married couple. Continued recusancy was followed by the piling up of dirt in front of their door upon every Feast-day. These injunctions were justified on the ground that the money extorted was devoted to divine service." 
  FU_Provence_Events.3.a: "Une telle connaissance!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.4.t: "The Forgotten Empire"
  FU_Provence_Events.4.d: "One of the brightest and most prestigious Empires to have ever existed, Byzantium once stood proud and mighty from the straits of Marmara to the markets of the Levant. With the advent of the Turks, the Empire fell to decay and eventually lost its old splendor. However, all is not lost. With the recent acquisition of the heartland of the forgotten Empire, we stand in a historic crossroad. To reanimate what is long lost and confiscate the prestige and legitimacy behind the Byzantine crown or to keep their lands as our own are both viable options."
  FU_Provence_Events.4.a: "Restore the glory of the purple phoenix!"
  FU_Provence_Events.4.b: "Eradicate the local loyalists and restore order!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.5.t: "The Capetian Dynasty" 
  FU_Provence_Events.5.d: "The Capetian House of Anjou was a royal house and cadet branch of the direct French House of Capet, part of the Capetian dynasty. It is one of three separate royal houses referred to as Angevin, meaning "from Anjou" in France. Founded by Charles I of Anjou, the youngest son of Louis VIII of France, the Capetian king first ruled the Kingdom of Sicily during the 13th century. Later the War of the Sicilian Vespers forced him out of the island of Sicily, leaving him with the southern half of the Italian Peninsula — the Kingdom of Naples. The house and its various branches would go on to influence much of the history of Southern and Central Europe during the Middle Ages, until becoming defunct in 1435. \nHistorically, the House ruled the counties of Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Provence and Forcalquier, the principalities of Achaea and Taranto, and the kingdoms of Sicily, Naples, Hungary, Croatia, Albania, and Poland. "
  FU_Provence_Events.5.a: "Let us restore our right to rule!"
  FU_Provence_Events.5.b: "The Capetian name shall elevate our prestige!"
  pro_capet_dynasty_heir_tt: "§YThe heir will be the founding member of the restored Capetian Dynasty§!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.6.t: "The Rade of the Toulon Arsenal" 
  FU_Provence_Events.6.d: "The word rade comes from the old English term 'Road' "a protected place near shore, not so enclosed as a harbour, where ships can ride at anchor.". The Rade of Toulon is one of the best natural anchorages on the Mediterranean, and the largest rade in Europe. It is protected from the sea by the peninsula of Giens and the peninsula of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, and has been used as a military harbour since the 15th century. The Rade shelters the port of Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, the port of La Seyne-sur-Mer, as well as the arsenal, or military port of Toulon, and the commercial port. \n\nThe early modern history of the port began when [Root.Monarch.GetName] built his Tour Royale at Toulon in [GetYear]. A naval arsenal and shipyard were built simultaneously, and small sheltered harbour, the Veille Darse, was built a few years later to protect ships from the wind and sea. The shipyard was greatly enlarged by a later Cardinal, who wished to make Provence into a Mediterranean naval power." 
  FU_Provence_Events.6.a: "Let it be built!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.7.t: "Archbishop Giuliano della Rovere"
  FU_Provence_Events.7.d: "Julius II, original name Giuliano della Rovere, (born Dec. 5, 1443, Albisola, Republic of Genoa—died Feb. 21, 1513, Rome), greatest art patron of the papal line (reigned 1503–13) and one of the most powerful rulers of his age. Although he led military efforts to prevent French domination of Italy, Julius is most important for his close friendship with Michelangelo and for his patronage of other artists, including Bramante and Raphael. He commissioned Michelangelo’s “Moses” and paintings in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael’s frescoes in the Vatican.\n\nStarting as a mere Cardinal in the city of Avignon, he led efforts to elevate the city in terms of urbanization as well as the flow of Renaissance by funding local artists and people of thought. Having captured the city, it is up to us to decide how to handle such a man of exceptional skill." 
  FU_Provence_Events.7.a: "Let him remodel its walls!"
  FU_Provence_Events.7.b: "He will make a fine general."
  FU_Provence_Events.7.c: "Use his expertise in royal matters, instead."
 
  FU_Provence_Events.8.t: "Mending the Western Schism"
  FU_Provence_Events.8.d: "The existence of the Antipope of Avignon is a bitter reminder of Catholicism's dark past. The recently developed friendship with the Duchy of Provence, however, has given way to the animosities of the past. Despite our good will and intentions, the Provencal diplomats insist that in order to prove our sincerety, we ought to return the province of Avignon back to them." 
  FU_Provence_Events.8.a: "Very well." 
  FU_Provence_Events.8.b: "We will respectfully decline."
 
  FU_Provence_Events.9.t: "The Kingdom of Jerusalem" 
  FU_Provence_Events.9.d: "Our victories in the far corners of the Mediterranean Sea have led to the recapture of the Holy City of Jerusalem! All of Christianity signs our praise as our mighty troops parade through the main streets, waving the Provencal coat of arms. Despite our newfound strength and victories, many European diplomats advocate the re-establishment of the Crusader State of Jerusalem as a sign of devout piety and strength of faith. Despite their calls, however, it would be wise for us to decide based on merit and the preservation of our people's prosperity." 
  FU_Provence_Events.9.a: "Make it so!"
  FU_Provence_Events.9.b: "Jerusalem belongs to us."
 
  FU_Provence_Events.10.t: "The Many Titles of Rene I de Valois" 
  FU_Provence_Events.10.d: "Despite our size, our Good King Rene is a man of many titles. Titular to many and direct descendant to many thrones, from France to Aragon, Naples and Sicily. Naples in particular was only recently taken away from our great monarch by the traitorous Alfons V of Aragon. We shall not allow this to stand, the Kingdom of Naples along with all its fiefs must be returned to its proper owner!" 
  FU_Provence_Events.10.a: "We will reclaim their throne!"
  FU_Provence_Events.10.b: "Their lands belong to us!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.11.t: "The Gabelle Tax" 
  FU_Provence_Events.11.d: "The gabelle was a very unpopular tax on salt in the French region that was established during the mid-14th century and lasted, with brief lapses and revisions, until 1946. The term gabelle is derived from the Italian gabella (a duty), itself originating from the Arabic word qabala, "he received".\n\nIn Provence, the gabelle was originally an indirect tax that was applied to agricultural and industrial commodities, such as bed sheets, wheat, spices, and wine. However, from the 14th century onward, the gabelle was limited and solely referred to the Provencal crown's taxation of salt.\n\nBecause the gabelle affected all Provencal citizens (for use in cooking, for preserving food, for making cheese, and for raising livestock) and propagated extreme regional disparities in salt prices, the salt tax stood as one of the most hated and grossly unequal forms of revenue generation in the country's history. Repealed in 1790 by the National Assembly in the midst of the French Revolution, the gabelle was later reinstated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806. To impose such a tax may prove widely unpopular, yet passing on the opportunity to collect extra funds may also prove to be disastrous." 
  FU_Provence_Events.11.a: "Enforce the tax." 
  FU_Provence_Events.11.b: "Abolish it!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.12.t: "The Sanseverino Family" 
  FU_Provence_Events.12.d: "Originally a very powerful and influential family in Napoli, the Sanseverino family were obliterated once the Aragonese monarch Alfonso V de Trastamara assaulted the Kingdom, concluding with its integration under Aragon's crown and law. Despite advesities, the family proved great allies of the King Rene I de Valois and in fact was so influential they produced a large number of jurors, administratiors and noble lords. To reinstate the family in its previous post would certainly mean that we would have to give up some royal land for them to anchor on and further emnpower the powerful noble class in our realm."
  FU_Provence_Events.12.a: "Restore the fiefs of the family!"
  FU_Provence_Events.12.b: "It would be prudent to empower the crown, instead."
 
  FU_Provence_Events.13.t: "Provencal Quilts"
  FU_Provence_Events.13.d: "The term Provençal quilting, also known as boutis, refers to the wholecloth quilts done using a stuffing technique traditionally made in the South of France from the 17th century onwards. Boutis is a Provençal word meaning 'stuffing', describing how two layers of fabric are quilted together with stuffing sandwiched between sections of the design, creating a raised effect. The three main forms of the Provençal quilt are matelassage, piqure de Marseilles (also known as Marseilles work or piqué marseillais), and boutis. These terms, along with trapunto are often debated and confused, but they are all forms of stuffed quilting associated with the region." 
  FU_Provence_Events.13.a: "We weave the history of our nation!"
 
  FU_Provence_Events.14.t: "Le Livre des Tournois"
  FU_Provence_Events.14.d: "To the very noble and powerful prince, my very dear, beloved and only brother Charles of Anjou, Count of Maine, Mortain and Guise, \n\n'I, René of Anjou your brother, want you to know that because I have long known you to take pleasure in hearing new stories and tales, I have decided to make for you a little treatise, the longest that I know of, on the form and way in which I think a tourney ought to be undertaken at court or elsewhere in the marches of France, as certain princes like to have it done. I have taken this form mostly from that used for organizing tourneys in Germany and on the Rhine, but also from the customs that they follow in Flanders and Brabant, and in the same way from the ancient customs that we used to follow in France, which I have found written down in manuscripts. From these three customs I have taken what seems good to me, and have made and compiled from them a fourth way of holding a tourney, as you will see, if it pleases you, by what follows hereafter.' \n\nLe Livre des tournois (Traicte de la Forme de Devis d'un Tournoi) or King René's Tournament Book is a treatise describing rules for tournaments by the French prince René d'Anjou. It is best known from what appears to be Rene's own illuminated copy from the 1460s. \n\nThe description given in the book is different from that of the pas d'armes held at Razilly and Saumur; conspicuously absent are the allegorical and chivalresque ornamentations that were in vogue at the time. René instead emphasizes he is reporting on ancient tournament customs of France, Germany and the Low Countries, combining them in a new suggestion on how to hold a tournament. The tournament described is a melee fought by two sides. Individual jousts are only briefly mentioned. " 
  FU_Provence_Events.14.a: "An interesting read!"
