 FU_Novgorod_Events.1.t: "The Lands Beyond the Portages"
 FU_Novgorod_Events.1.d: "Some territories of relatively late Novgorod colonization were not included in the five–fold division and formed a number of volosts that were in a special position: Zavolochye or Dvinskaya land – along the Northern Dvina from Onega to Mezen. This volost was called so because it was located behind the portage – the watershed separating the Onega and Northern Dvina basins from the Volga basin and was located behind the Obonezhskaya and Bezhetskaya pyatins, where the portages to the Onega river (Poonezhie) began. Perm – in the basin of the Vychegda River and the upper Kama. Pechora – beyond the Dvina land and Perm to the north–east on both banks of the Pechora River to the Ural Range. Ugra – on the eastern side of the Ural Range. Tre or Tersky Coast – on the White Sea coast. The Siberian fur trade is an exchange concerned with the gathering, buying and selling of valuable animal furs that originate from Siberia. \n\nThe Siberian fur trade expanded from localized trade in Novgorod, and Siberian fur is now traded around the region and beyond. Its riches will have a  a significant impact on the development of urban centres through the erection of new buildings and the process of urbanization."  
 FU_Novgorod_Events.1.a: "Let there be fur!"
 fur_cash_tt: "based on our Fur production."
 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.2.t: "A Friendly Request" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.2.d: "The head of the Novgorodian diplomatic corps has presented us with a soft request. In exchange for our continuous cooperation, the city of Novgorod demands we hand the province of Vyborg to them, along with the populace and estates of the area." 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.2.a: "Some land means nothing when it comes to friendship and alliance!"
 FU_Novgorod_Events.2.b: "They will pry it from our cold dead hands!"
 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.3.t: "Lord Novgorod the Great" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.3.d: "Our Novgorod Republic,also known as 'Novgorodian Land'; as a medieval East Slavic state from the 12th to 15th centuries, stretching from the Gulf of Finland in the west to the northern Ural Mountains in the east, including the city of Novgorod and the Lake Ladoga regions of modern Russia. Citizens referred to their city-state as "His Majesty (or Sovereign) Lord Novgorod the Great" (Gosudar Gospodin Veliky Novgorod), or more often as "Lord Novgorod the Great" (Gospodin Veliky Novgorod). The Republic prospered as the easternmost port of the Hanseatic League and its Slavic, Baltic and Finnic people were much influenced by the culture of the Viking-Varangians and Byzantine people.\n\nHowever, despite our apparent decay during the early 15th century, our newfound glory and victories over the Grand Kniaz of Muscovy have given our people hope for a brighter future of prosperity and sovereignty." 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.3.a: "This is surely a sign of God's favor!"
 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.4.t: "Administrating the Tribes" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.4.d: "Raids between tribes were prevalent throughout the region's history. This is connected to the ease with which a defeated enemy's flocks can be driven away, making raiding profitable. In terms of warfare and raiding, in relation to sedentary societies, the horse gave the nomads an advantage of mobility. Horsemen could raid a village and retreat with their loot before an infantry-based army could be mustered and deployed. When confronted with superior infantry, horsemen could simply ride away and retreat and regroup. Outside of Europe and parts of the Middle East, agrarian societies had difficulty raising a sufficient number of war horses, and often had to enlist them from their nomadic enemies (as mercenaries). \n\nHowever, the steppes of Russia are plentiful of both horses and manpower. To that end, we could very well offer these unruly tribes an offer to join civilization as part of our court and army ranks." 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.4.a: "Grant them citizenship and integrate them into our court!" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.4.b: "They belong under our boot and they deserve nought but the whip!"
 
 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.5.t: "Novgorod and the Hansa" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.5.d: "It is indeed true that we have a turbulent history with the cities and territories attributed to the Hanseatic League. Despite their old power, nowadays the League is nothing but a shadow of its former help. Most foreign cities confined the Hanseatic traders to certain trading areas and to their own trading posts. They seldom interacted with the local inhabitants, except when doing business. Many locals, merchant and noble alike, envied the power of the League and tried to diminish it. For example, in London, the local merchants exerted continuing pressure for the revocation of privileges. The refusal of the Hansa to offer reciprocal arrangements to their English counterparts exacerbated the tension. King Edward IV of England reconfirmed the league's privileges in the Treaty of Utrecht despite the latent hostility, in part thanks to the significant financial contribution the League made to the Yorkist side during the Wars of the Roses of 1455–1487. In 1597 Queen Elizabeth of England expelled the League from London, and the Steelyard closed the following year. \n\nGiven the apparent decline the League is facing, perhaps it would be wise for us to retake the territory they once took from us." 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.5.a: "Their lands will make a great addition to our collection."
 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.6.t: "The Era of the Horse Coming to an End" 
 FU_Novgorod_Events.6.d: "For years the people of the steppe enjoyed tremendous autonomy under the regional administration of the Novgorodian officials. As the era of Absolutism and control is upon us, these men have come to realize that their time is long over. To that extent, local attempts to integrate these unruly elements have been remarkably successful, resulting in their traditions and way of administration molding with our society."
 FU_Novgorod_Events.6.a: "So ends the era of the raiders and autonomy..."
