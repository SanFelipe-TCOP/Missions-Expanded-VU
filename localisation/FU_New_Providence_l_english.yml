 nss_secure_north_carribean_title: "Secure the West Caribbean" 
 nss_secure_north_carribean_desc: "Seaborne Piracy is nothing new to the European states; from the Mediterranean sea to the greater Atlantic all that's new the is sheer distance and wealth in these newfound seas. While we have gained our glorious foothold we must learn as those European powers learned before us, the means to control and defend our vital sea lanes to discourage and throw back any and all of the old world powers. We need to secure defensive positions and fortify them under our fellowship.  " 
 nss_port_royal_title: "Port Royal" 
 nss_port_royal_desc: "Ambition is something many in our ranks have in droves, we are not lacking for skill to back this ambition with some men showing a major capacity for both governing and commanding vessels. With Port Royal growing in prosperity one man is petitioning for autonomy with promises of fair governance and military service. Denying his request will likely see him improve the province as a local governor and a patron of Arr-chitects, although a sensible choice is that really the most interesting option in our growing republic? " 
 nss_caribbean_queen_title: "Caribbean Queen" 
 nss_caribbean_queen_desc: "Now we're sharing the same dream, And our hearts they beat as one, No more love on the run! Trade is the tiger we wanted to tame, yet some in the old world are fairly lame, do we want europes tradesmen when our nation has the peak of the same?"
 
 nss_reshape_sea_routes_title: "Reshape the Sea Routes"
 nss_reshape_sea_routes_desc: "While trade can be highly lucrative it is also a risky venture. Especially across the passings into the Indian and Chinese seas simple out of sheer distance, and the ocean never says anything to the pirates. It just waves. After someone slapped the cartographer who said that, discussions were held on a great digging terraforming project in the central Americas around Panama, it will be expensive in terms of both human cost to dig out that jungle, yet developing the location will have a profound impact on the ease of trade, and this projected Canal shows nothing short of profound benefit. " 
 nss_dominate_overseas_trade_title: "Dominate European Trade" 
 nss_dominate_overseas_trade_desc: "The pirates live their lives to the fullest. They know how to seas the day. And all European Cargo ships they can get their hooks on, in fact no single european nation has been able to stop our control of the seas as we've become something of a Hegemon. Even our non-illicit shipping of normal goods go unmolested by any other navy, despite how salty they may be, increasing our efforts may lead to our powers being officially recognized to the world at large. "

 nss_sic_parvis_magna_desc: "'So great and so small' according to a particularly well learned member of our new fellowship, he is not wrong, our newfound collection of veteran sailors, ex-privateers, unscrupulous traders and ambitious individuals make up our state.

 nss_pearl_antilles_title: "Peal of the Antilles" 
 nss_pearl_antilles_desc: "Hispaniola's value to our Republic is so obvious as to be comical, as the second largest island in the region it's rich soil, richness in natural resources and strategic location makes for a valuable settlement and base of operations, it is the Pearl of the Antilles. With that in mind some simple development should quickly make this another great bastion of trade and a beacon of our might in the area. " 
 nss_develop_cigar_production_title: "Establish Puros Production" 
 nss_develop_cigar_production_desc: "After dinner, everyone ought to have a cigar. So, I tried it, well, the rest is history. I'm still smoking stogies, I love it, and he introduced me to something really good. \n\nAnd, I know now the next question. Knowing you, uh, being the interviewer that you are, digging in deep all the time, you will say now: "what does your wife think about that?" \n\nLet me ask you something. When my wife's father has introduced me to stogies, what is she gonna say? She's not gonna say "my father made a mistake" because her father never makes a mistake. So, therefore, it is ok. I can smoke stogies around her. I can smoke stogies in my house, first of all, because her father introduced me to stogies, and second of all because I am a stud. I'm ballsy. I don't take no shit from anyone. I smoke my stogie anywhere I want. I don't have to find a hideout place like YOU! UHOHOHOH! " 
 nss_gulf_aden_title: "Sail to Aden" 
 nss_gulf_aden_desc: "East of Africa lies a production center with an incredible wealth, in more than just the usual gold, slaves and silver. These ancient and varied brewing methods could provide a boon if only we could 'seas' the means of production." 
 nss_hunt_ganj_i_sawai_title: "Hunt the Ganj-i-Sawai"
 nss_hunt_ganj_i_sawai_desc: "Constructed by some foreign Empress this grand ship's capture is within our sight, with some bases in nearby Sri Lanka we could set up a heist in the effort to capture the great treasure this ship boasts. In what our enthusiastic crew dub Operation Thief's End this truly will be the end for their need to thieve for the remained of their lives, and the pirate code will grand our Republic no small share of the loot!"

 nss_people_of_the_islands_desc: "Excitement in in the air, and a whole lot of spirits are raised high by our foundation. While those individuals drink themselves raw others need to consider where they'll live and grow in these islands we call home, to plan where new colonies and conquests for the propagation of themselves and our republic. This cannot wait, we must seize the high mood and the high seas! As one particularly drunk pirate said, 'To err is human. But to arr is pirate.' " 
 nss_windward_leeward_title: "Windward & Leeward"
 nss_windward_leeward_desc: "As apposed to the direction of the wind, these areas boast an incredible production of timber, which 'wood' boost our production of ships incredibly, it's an easy decision from there to control it's production for the sake of our navies. "

 #nss_contact_far_east_pirates_title: "Contact the Far East Pirates" 
 #nss_contact_far_east_pirates_desc: "All of our Conquests have given us bases to truly deal with the great east asian Powers, although we are not the first to do so. Piracy is as old as trade and tales of such have begun drifting to us, as information about us drifts towards them. Wealth of an incredibly magnitude and rumours of a Pirate Queen who stalks terror into the depsots she opposes. Recruitment is high and excitement palpable while we extend our hand towards these legends of the east, our new combined focus may soon lay with the 'Land of the Rising Sun'. "

 nss_voyage_west_africa_title: "Voyage to West Africa" 
 nss_voyage_west_africa_desc: "All men are equal under our code, although some old ideas prevail from our parent societies we broke free from, and our newfound conquests and bases in west africa prove some eager recruits, although here slavery by their fellow man is common. Our Voyages prove that with proper treatment black slave sailors perform well under moderate exploitation. However these potential crew are capable and disease resistant, some young leaders argue that Africans are no lesser men, and that it wouldn't take long for them to prove themselves to the old. "

 nss_safe_haven_title: "A Safe Haven" 
 nss_safe_haven_desc: "The Capital we control is our great base of operations, and serves as a natural harbor for our safety and our ships. Constructing greater systems of crew recruitment and shipbuilding will help increase its value for both aspect. "

 #Events
 FU_New_Providence_Events.1.t: "Sodom of the New World"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.1.d: "Our marooning activities across the seas of the Caribbean have long since troubled the nations of the old world. As our influence expands from island to island, foreign powers seek to undo our newfound Republic. To solidify our areal privateering operations, many suggest the creation of a sibling pirate Republic at the island of Jamaica. A place to unwind and enjoy booze and women after a long hard day of skulduggery!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.1.a: "Let there be skulduggery, arrrgh!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.1.b: "We best keep the isle to ourselves, yarr..."
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.2.t: "Trading with the Old World" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.2.d: "Despite our desire to detach our Republic from the Europeans, trade is a constant reality that befalls our Captains, given the geographic location of our island domain. Thus, it's our responsibility to decide the degree in which we will engage in consensual trade with foreign merchants, for the good of our sailors and citizens of [Root.GetName]!" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.2.a: "Impose tarrifs on these land lovers!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.2.b: "They are not welcome at all."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.2.e: "Yes but I like colonizing!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.3.t: "Greatness from Small Beginnings"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.3.d: "Sic parvis magna. That was the Latin inscription on the ring of Sir Francis Drake, a famous privateer forever remembered in the history books. It means 'greatness, from small beginnings'. It’s an apt description of our newly-found Republic as we sail forth into known and unknown seas, history will engrave our names with golden letters and the world will tremble at the sight of our glorious flag!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.3.a: "§MAnd thus our tail begins, in the open seas...§!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.4.t: "A Legendary Pirate - Edward Thatch Appears!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.4.d: "One of the most terrifying and bloodcurdling pirates to ever sail the 7 seas, Edward Thatch, better known  as Blackbeard, has arrived at our capital port. Legend has it that his beard would light ablaze, engulfed in flames as he fought viciously and commanded his men into the jaws of oblivion. Such was his legend and prestige that after his inevitable death, his severed head went on to adorn the prow of the Lieutenant Robert Maynard’s ship as a warning to other pirates in the area as a trophy of Maynard overpowering the legendary pirate."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.4.a: "§bBlackbeard§! be his name!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.5.t: "Capture of the Exceeding Treasure!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.5.d: "In August 1695, Every and the Fancy reached the Mandab Strait, where he teamed up with four other pirate ships, including Thomas Tew's sloop Amity. Although a 25-ship Mughal convoy bound for India had eluded the pirate fleet during the night, the following day they encountered the Ganj-i-Sawai, and its escort Fateh Muhammed, both stragglers passing the straits en route to Surat.\n\nEvery and his men attacked the Fateh Muhammed, which had earlier repulsed an attack by the Amity, killing Captain Tew. Perhaps intimidated by the Fancy's 46 guns or weakened by their earlier battle with Tew, the Fateh Muhammed's crew put up little resistance, and Every's pirates sacked the ship for £50,000 worth of treasure. \n\nEvery now sailed in pursuit of the Ganj-i-Sawai, overtaking her about eight days out of Surat. The Ganj-i-Sawai was a fearsome opponent, mounting 62 guns and a musket-armed guard of four to five hundred, as well as six hundred other passengers. But the opening volley evened the odds, as one of the Indian ship's cannons exploded, killing some of its gunners and causing great confusion and demoralization among the crew, while Every's broadside shot his enemy's mainmast by the board. The Fancy drew alongside the Ganj-i-Sawai and the pirates clambered aboard."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.5.a: "A trophy for the ages!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.6.t: "Barriers against the Rich and Powerful"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.6.d: "The island of Madagascar will serve our fleet as a mighty important forward port of operations as our reach extends beyond the shores of Africa. However, a lieutenant in our crew, Misson, suggested we give him nominal control of the island to be administered as a subject under our proud flag. He went on to say such a move would only bolster our ranks with allies, ships and new sailors he would recruit locally on the island towns. \n\nThese pirates who settled in Libertalia would be 'vigilant Guardians of the People's Rights and Liberties'. They would stand as 'Barriers against the Rich and Powerful' of their day. By waging war on behalf of 'the Oppressed' against the 'Oppressors,' they would see that 'Justice was equally distributed'. " 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.6.a: "They will thrive under the black jolly roger!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.6.b: "We cannot forgo the island..."
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.8.t: "Pirate Empress of China" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.8.d: "Born as Shi Yang to humble origins, she married Zheng Yi, a local and famed pirate of the Chinese coast, at age 26. Her name was a honorific bestowed upon her by the people of Guangdong, meaning wife of Zheng Yi. After the death of her husband, she bravely took control of his pirate confederation with the support of his adopted son Zhang Bao, who she entered into a relationship with and later married. As the unofficial commander of the Guangdong Pirate Confederation, her fleet was composed of 400 junks and between 40,000 to 60,000 pirates in 1805. Her ships entered into conflict with several major powers, such as the East India Company, the Portuguese Empire, and Qing China. The addition of such a powerful ally in our ranks only serves to signify our innate legitimacy as the world's foremost privateering power." 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.8.a: "Fortune has lifted her high!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.9.t: "The Slaves of West Africa" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.9.d: "The soul of Africa herself is at stake, as the Europeans' greed strikes deep within the continent's core. Men torn from their families and women taken as loot, their cruelty is merrily inflicted upon those less fortunate. As our influence creeps ever so closely to the Ivory Coast shores, we must decide  the fate of those whose luck led them to be nought more than mere flesh to be sold. Should we decide to commit against the enslavement of the natives, the legendary pirate known as 'Black Caesar' will join our ranks!" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.9.a: "They are equals to us in the eyes of the Republic, ayee!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.9.b: "We be pirates! We be exploiting!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.t: "Legendary Pirates - Anne Bonny & Mary Read"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.d: "§RThe Story of Anne Bonny§! \nBorn as a child out of wedlock between her father William and his maid, young Anne grew with a fiery temper and a knack for chaos. William, a successful planter, disapproved of his daughter’s rebellious ways; the endless rumors about her carousing in local taverns and sleeping with fishermen and drunks damaged his business. Not long after, Anne decided to set sail and try her luck at privateering. A surprising number of women ventured to sea, in many capacities; as servants, prostitutes, laundresses, cooks and, albeit less frequently, as sailors, naval officers, whaling merchants or pirates. Anne herself was likely inspired by a 16th-century Irishwoman named Grace O’Malley. Upon joining Rackam’s crew and separating with her former husband, she was said to have silenced a disparaging shipmate by stabbing him in the heart. Most of the time Anne lived as a woman, acting the part of Rackam’s lover and helpmate, but during engagements with other ships she wore the attire of a man such as a loose tunic and wide, short trousers; a sword hitched by her side and a brace of pistols tucked in a sash; a small cap perched atop a thicket of dark hair.\n\n§RThe Story of Mary Read§! \nMary's story is similar. Her mother’s first child was a boy, born shortly after her husband died at sea. Mary’s mother-in-law took pity on the widow and offered to support her grandson but he died as well. Mary’s mother became pregnant again, gave birth to Mary, and, in order to keep receiving money from her husband’s family, dressed her daughter to resemble her dead son.But her grandmother soon caught on and terminated the arrangement. To make ends meet, Mary’s mother continued dressing her as a boy and rented her out as a servant. \nMary excelled at living as a man. As a child, she served as a 'powder monkey' on a British ship during the War of the Grand Alliance, carrying gunpowder from the ship’s hold to the gun crews. Next, she served in both the infantry and cavalry, in Flanders. She fell in love with her bunkmate and divulged her secret to him. Initially, the soldier suggested that Mary become his mistress. However, Mary replied, that she was a reserved and proper lady. After informing her entire regiment that she was a woman, she quit the army and married the solider, who died shortly after. \nMary resumed her life as a man and sailed for the West Indies on a vessel which was soon captured by English pirates. The crew, believing her to be an Englishman, encouraged her to join them. Calico Jack served as the quartermaster of her new crew, and none of them ever suspected Mary’s true gender. She was aggressive and ruthless, always ready for a raid, and swore like a drunken sailor. Loose clothing hid her breasts, and no one thought twice about her lack of facial hair; her mates, most of them in their teens or early twenties, were also smooth-faced." 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.a: "Hire Anne Bonny!"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.b: "Hire Mary Read instead."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.c: "Why not both?"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.10.e: "Away you go, vile wenches!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.11.t: "A Legendary Pirate - Black Sam Bellamy"
 FU_New_Providence_Events.11.d: "Bellamy and his crew captured 53 ships before he died in a shipwreck at 28. They called him Black Sam Bellamy because he eschewed the fashion for powdered wigs and wore his black hair tied with a black satin bow. He had good manners, dressed neatly in fancy clothes, and he always wore four ornate dueling pistols in his sash. Black Sam Bellamy called himself  ‘Robin Hood of the Sea,’ and his men called themselves ‘Robin Hood’s men.’ There is no record of him ever killing a captive, and he often returned captured ships and cargo if they didn’t suit his purpose. Later, Bellamy and his crew captured the Whydah Gally, a slave ship he refitted as a flagship with 28 guns. The Whydah had an advanced weapons system capable of attacking any man-of-war in the Americas The Whydah Gally also captured a sloop under the command of a Capt. Beers. Black Sam Bellamy wanted to let him keep his ship, but his crew had voted to burn it. Bellamy asked the captain to join the pirates, and Beers declined. That allegedly inspired the speech attributed to the pirate; \n§GI am sorry they won’t let you have your sloop again, for I scorn to do any one a mischief, when it is not to my advantage; damn the sloop, we must sink her, and she might be of use to you. \nThough you are a sneaking puppy, and so are all those who will submit to be governed by laws which rich men have made for their own security; for the cowardly whelps have not the courage otherwise to defend what they get by knavery; but damn ye altogether: damn them for a pack of crafty rascals, and you, who serve them, for a parcel of hen-hearted numbskulls.\nThey vilify us, the scoundrels do, when there is only this difference, they rob the poor under the cover of law, forsooth, and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage. Had you not better make then one of us, than sneak after these villains for employment?§!" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.11.a: "Come aboard, lad!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.12.t: "A Legendary Pirate - William Kidd" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.12.d: "William Kidd was the son of a minister in Greenock and was born around 1645. He emigrated to New York and married there, earning his living as a sea captain and a trader in the Caribbean. He successfully defended American and English trade routes in the 1690s in the war between France and England. \nIn 1695 Kidd sailed to London where he obtained a royal commission to act as a privateer against pirates in the Indian Ocean, operating from bases in Madagascar. Reports came back to England, however, that he was attacking merchant ships as well as pirates. \nAfter capturing the fully laden 'Quedah Merchant' with cargo worth over several fortunes, he returned to Hispaniola. He was offered a pardon for his surrender and he sailed to Boston. He was treacherously captured and taken to London. In a rigged trial, with little real evidence and despite his claim that his crew had mutinied and he had no alternative but to join them, he was found guilty and hanged. The treasure from the 'Quedah Merchant' would never be recovered or found." 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.12.a: "A not so fickle and faithless generation."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.12.b: "He will make a fine head for our Republic."
 FU_New_Providence_Events.12.c: "Never!"
 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.13.t: "A Legendary Pirate - Jack Sparrow" 
 FU_New_Providence_Events.13.d: "The son of Captain Edward Teague, Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship in a typhoon. Before he was known as "Captain Jack Sparrow", he was simply known as Jack, a teenage stowaway who, even then, had a desire for adventure. Jack first sailed on the Barnacle with a young ragtag crew on a quest to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Cortés. As a young pirate he earned the name Jack Sparrow when he trapped the notorious Spanish pirate hunter Capitán Salazar in the Devil's Triangle. Years after his teenage adventures, an encounter with the infamous rogue pirates forced him to abandon the pirate life and take employment in the East India Trading Company. After five years of faithful service, during which he sailed across all the Seven Seas, he was given command of the Wicked Wench, a ship owned by Cutler Beckett, the EITC Director for West Africa. As Beckett's employee, Jack searched for the mystical island of Kerma and its legendary treasure, until he decided to betray Beckett and keep the island and its inhabitants safe from Beckett and his slave traders. When Beckett contracted him to transport a cargo of slaves to the Bahamas, Jack chose to liberate them and steal the Wench from Beckett. However, Beckett's men managed to find him and branded him as a pirate, while the Wench was set aflame and sunk. After striking a bargain with Davy Jones, the ghostly captain of the Flying Dutchman, to resurrect his beloved vessel, Jack had the Wench renamed the Black Pearl and began the pirate life anew. At some point, Jack Sparrow became one of the nine Pirate Lords, his domain being the Caribbean Sea. "
