 #Mission
 fla_banners_of_rebellion_title: "Banners of Rebellion"
 fla_banners_of_rebellion_desc: "Raise the Flemish Lion. The time has come to fight for Flanders. Let the nobles raise their men and open their coffers. Send our declaration of war throughout the realm. But will this be enough? Mayhaps contracting the local men should be considered." 
 fla_fortify_gravensteen_title: "Fortify Graventsteen"
 fla_fortify_gravensteen_desc: "The Gravensteen Castle in Gent has traditionally been the seat of the counts of Flanders. Our Burgundian masters have let this august fortification fall into disrepair though. It should be repaired and refortified. With its high walls and deep moat, it will be both a imposing residence as well as a formidable defense against invaders."
 fla_presence_holland_title: "Presence in Holland"
 fla_presence_holland_desc: "The neighboring county of Holland has long been one of our fiercest rivals in the region. The time has come to put an end to them once and for all. The Red Lion must submit to the black. Vlaenderen die leu!" 
 fla_proclaim_dutch_republic_title: "To Defend our People"
 fla_proclaim_dutch_republic_desc: "Flanders is free, but for how long? The Dutch have too long danced to the tunes of foreign overlords. We need to unite the Dutch Lowlands under our banner. Together we can form a strong, united and free Dutch nation." 
 fla_prepare_army_title: "Prepare the Army"
 fla_prepare_army_desc: "Our Army has been long neglected by our Burgundian overlords. If we are to defend ourselves and project power over our neighbors, we need to build up a core of competent officers to lead them. Hear us roar." 
 fla_sign_charter_liberty_title: "Charter of Liberty"
 fla_sign_charter_liberty_desc: "The cities of the Lowlands have long since been used to govern themselves without interference. Our recent land acquisitions have caused quite a stir among the citizens of the more influential polities in our realm. Officially ensuring the continuation of these privileges in an official charter would put the fears of the guilds to rest and encourage them to return their focus to the wellbeing of their enterprises." 
 fla_take_wallonia_title: "Secure the South"
 fla_take_wallonia_desc: "The Walloons to our South have also long suffered foreign oppression. As protector of the maltreated men of the Lowlands, it is our duty to liberate them. This is sure to bring us their eternal gratitude. Capturing and fortifying their Fortress at Luxemburg would also ensure the safety of our Southern border." 
 fla_passing_philip_title: "End of an Era"
 fla_passing_philip_desc: "Flanders has been ruled by the house of Burgundy since the death of Lois II in 1384. While life is good under the shrewd stewardship of Phillipe the Good, some started whispering of independence in the streets and taverns. Should the good duke pass a time of great uncertainty and opportunity might be ahead of us."
 fla_princely_diplomacy_title: "Princely Diplomacy"
 fla_princely_diplomacy_desc: "The courts of Europe are filled with dark secrets and potential allies. These secrets and friends could be of great worth to us. Especially our fellow Lowland counties could be useful friends. Alternatively, we could also try to dominate them through force of arms."
 fla_flanders_lion_title: "Flanders the Lion!"
 fla_flanders_lion_desc: "Flanders is free. The leeuwenvlag again flies on the towers of Brugge. However, our young independent nation is still in turmoil. We need time to bring peace and stability to our lands. Burned farms shall be rebuild and malcontents dealt with. The resulting prosperity would fill our subjects hearts with love and our coffers with coin."
 fla_studium_generale_lovaniense_title: "Studium Lovaniense"
 fla_studium_generale_lovaniense_desc: "In 1425 John IV of Brabant founded the Studium Generale Lovaniese university in Leuven. This institution has shown some promise, but further work needs to be done in order to make it a true center of learning. In the Italian fashion funding institutions of learning has become quite fashionable. Let us expand the campus to create a true center of science and theology. This should attract many talented scholars to our lands."
 fla_maritime_equity_title: "End Maritime Equity"
 fla_maritime_equity_desc: "There is fierce competition among the merchants of the different states of the Lowlands. Maritime commerce is the lifeblood of Flanders. We must bind this trade to us. Managing this would greatly increase the standing of our main trading port in Brugge." 
 fla_heropbouw_edict_title: "Heropbouw Edict"
 fla_heropbouw_edict_desc: "Every nation needs an impressive capital. With our independence secured and prosperity ensured it is time to turn our eyes towards improvement. Let us secure funds and rebuild our capital into a seat of government befitting the splendor of our nation. Once our capital has been remodeled, we can continue to modernize our other holdings."
 fla_restore_cities_title: "Restore the Cities"
 fla_restore_cities_desc: "While our capital has been remodeled into a splendid city, many of our other towns still consist of the tight dark streets and dirty cramped buildings our ancestors build in centuries past. These conditions are unsanitary and cause discontent within the citizenry. The concerns of the citizens need to be addressed. Modernize our cities and rebuild the cathedrals of the land to show that Flanders has become a modern, wealthy nation." 
 fla_expand_lakenhallen_title: "Expand the Lakenhallen"
 fla_expand_lakenhallen_desc: "Our country has been shaped by the trade that flows through it. Many prominent merchants have made our capital ports their safe havens in their maritime adventures, pursuing commerce and coin. To accommodate the increase in mercantile activities, it is vital to expand the existing lakenhallen, a combination of warehouses and marketplaces in order to house the newly-resurging merchant class."
 fla_english_court_title: "Delegate the English Court"
 fla_english_court_desc: "The English have long been our closest trading partners. However, our merchants have been complaining about the stifling English dominance in the Channel. We need to decide how we want to develop this relationship. Shall we treat them as friend of foe in the future?"
 fla_pale_calais_title: "Pale of Calais"
 fla_pale_calais_desc: "Calais has become one of the most prosperous ports in Northern Europe. Our merchants need access to its markets, be it through diplomacy or outright seizure. The combined might of Calais and Brugge would pose a significant threat to the influence of London as a tradeport."
 fla_golden_standard_title: "Golden Standard"
 fla_golden_standard_desc: "As a coastal nation we need a strong navy to ensure the safety of our shores and merchant fleets. With recent innovations in naval warfare larger warships have come to play a pivotal part of any fleet. We need our own and capable officers to lead them if we want to challenge the established naval powers of the Atlantic. The creation of new shipyards will serve us well in the years to come."
 fla_land_cloth_title: "Land of Cloth"
 fla_land_cloth_desc: "Flemish wool cloth has been our most sought after export for centuries. With our Lakkenhallen expanded to accommodate the massive influx of foreign merchants, demand has far outstripped our production of textiles. We need to establish new weaving houses and dyer workshops to meet this demand. By out pricing our competitors in Northern Italy we will become rich beyond imagining."
