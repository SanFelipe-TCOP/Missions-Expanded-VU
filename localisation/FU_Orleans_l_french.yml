 orl_holy_cross_cathedral_title: "Holy Cross Cathedral"
 orl_holy_cross_cathedral_desc: "The Cathedral of Sainte-Croix, among the earliest of the French Cathedrals had been razed by Norman raiders. Following an ambitious yet failed reconstruction attempt we remain with only preliminary designs of this third construct; Should we begin this task the planned cathedral's modern, fashionably Gothic designs would tower over the City of Orleans forevermore." 
 orl_tourelles_fort_title: "The Tourelles Fort" 
 orl_tourelles_fort_desc: "Orleans is the heart of our nation, the capital of our duchy and most pressingly in the center of France. In these turbulent times fortifications of all kinds must be erected and capable charges set to direct them to ensure our bid for independence, and especially to ensure our continued existence!"
 orl_along_the_loire_title: "Along the Loire" 
 orl_along_the_loire_desc: "Her significant strategic importance aside, the Loire River is a well known hot spot for couples, and her magnificence can hardly be overstated, with our defensive infrastructure secured some investment into valley and riverside châteaux should drastically improve income and prosperity of this beautiful 'Garden of France'." 
 orl_essence_renaissance_title: "Essence of Renaissance" 
 orl_essence_renaissance_desc: "True to the name Renaissance, this event has already been a great rebirth from once stagnant essence of European art and learning into a truly marvelous cultural movement. A paramount goal has made itself clear to which Orleans must not falter: acquisition and exploitation of this spirit of higher learning will certainly ease it's transition into our nation." 
 orl_university_orleans_title: "University of Orleans"
 orl_university_orleans_desc: "Our open dissemination of learning has truly given our university a great opportunity, now revered for scholars and their many applicable discoveries of self and culture. The University of Orleans has already brought many great men and women into the forefront of culture and politics. Open thought and allowance of expression already stand in high esteem and our once mighty fledgling nation must ride in the forefront, backed by her Universities growing list of Alumni who have grasped the essence of modern learning." 
 orl_march_paris_title: "March to Paris" 
 orl_march_paris_desc: "Orleans has learned from the siege of our castle all those years ago, a sentiment proved with the conquest of the great city of Paris and her constituent provinces. Reconnecting our capital to Valois is pleasing on the map, while the significance of this conquest greatly legitimizes our claim to all of France it also importantly grants more access to her institutions." 
 orl_order_of_st_joan_title: "Order of St. Joan" 
 orl_order_of_st_joan_desc: "Success in totality, Saint Joan's name is cleansed of all falsehood, and all in power singing the Saint's highest praises. Although some fools find the level of devotion worrying the sheer fervor should be used to it's full effect, whether through reform or other... Perhaps more 'Specialized' techniques." 
 orl_pursue_independence_title: "Pursue Independence" 
 orl_pursue_independence_desc: "We've suffered much in the past few centuries, from within and without. Much of our territory lost to greed and seizure; Yet we have learned much from the Maid of Orleans, our eyes are set on finally dealing with our subjugation. Now with our banners held high and our armies prepared, our independence is at an arms reach and we will suffer no other claims to our dynastic legacy and our destiny!" 
 orl_unite_provinces_title: "Unite the Provinces" 
 orl_unite_provinces_desc: "No longer a meager fraction of what was held at the height of Orleans' history, total connection of the once disparate territory greatly simplifies the administration of Orleans and this newfound power will be leveraged for internal centralization and much outward momentum." 
 orl_maid_orleans_title: "Maid of Orleans" 
 orl_maid_orleans_desc: "Joan of Arc's contributions to the hundred year's war are indisputable, King Charles' crowning in Reims was a result of her actions, and thereby grace of God. Her use as our national symbol and pride will be expanded after we remove the English from the north, but the influence we can wield is far more limited in comparison. Given the black stain on her reputation by the Church, the sole question is what degree of influence can mobilize to entreat on her behalf?" 
 orl_french_crown_title: "The French Crown"
 orl_french_crown_desc: "We hold the historic seat of power in Paris, we have cleared the name of Joan of Arc, and all that remains is to usurp the throne of France, it is time for §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! to seize the throne! All that remains is for the former government to be destroyed utterly to make way for the new regime." 
 orl_growth_economy_title: "Grow Our Economy"
 orl_growth_economy_desc: "Our Wealth is consolidated, and the coffers grow fuller with each passing day, now is the time to spend and utilize the plans for ever greater and effective economic growth, we certainly have come far since the hundred years war. " 
 orl_expand_orleans_title: "Expand Orleans"
 orl_expand_orleans_desc: "Given our newfound independence we must now carefully consider our next movements, dutifully plan out what we have now and from our conquests. Considering our newfound developments we should consider a path for the future of our duchy. The wealth achieved must be consolidated, the question is where?"

 #Events 
 FU_Orleans_Events.1.t: "The Beauty of the Loire" 
 FU_Orleans_Events.1.d: "The Gazebos have proven an effective allure for the younger nobility and the view certainly has cemented the reputation of the Loire River as the hot spot for budding romance and the 'Garden of France'. With the construction and advent of new and bold artistry carved into these small buildings the Renaissance's application throughout Europe and the dissemination of designs here prove a lively enhancement to the wonderful scenery. Today the River is calm, and there are some Ferry-Boats flowing gently carrying their cargo of Lords and Ladies." 
 FU_Orleans_Events.1.a: "Darling we MUST take a boatride, sometime!"
 
 FU_Orleans_Events.2.t: "The Second Coming of the Maid of Orleans" 
 FU_Orleans_Events.2.d: "Singular, unsettling tales suggested that Orleans Fortress itself was a gateway to some fabulous, unnameable power hidden deep beneath its foundation. With relic and ritual the sisterhood meant every effort towards the excavation and recovery of those long buried secrets, exhausting what remained of their collective fervor on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels. At last, in the salt-soaked cracks beneath the lowest foundation, they unearthed a portal of a crystalline appearance, no doubt containing power of antediluvian evil. Swirling and writhing of the portal perceived in almost infinite depth congeals at one point. If this is not stopped soon something will come through certain to reveal the fruits of their fervor and labor; a true abomination or perhaps a familiar face?" 
 FU_Orleans_Events.2.a: "She is... beautiful! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!" 
 FU_Orleans_Events.2.b: "Didn't we just spare no effort refuting claims of witchcraft? A nun's life for me!"
 
 FU_Orleans_Events.5.t: "A New Capital?"
 FU_Orleans_Events.5.d: "A Decision should be made, we have much in our stockpiles and the capability and the duty to carry out the task at hand, but for this we likely need to decide " 
 FU_Orleans_Events.5.a: "Paris will be the new capital."
 FU_Orleans_Events.5.b: "We best stay in Orleans."
 FU_Orleans_Events.5.c: "Let's keep our options open!"
